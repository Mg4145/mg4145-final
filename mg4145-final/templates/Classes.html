    <p> <b>Favorite Class:</b> Calculus II. This is my favorite class so far because I enjoy integrating and seeing its applications in real life. 
    Professor Woodbury enjoys answering questions that you might have from his material and he ensures that his students understand the material that's 
    being presented. Students get the opportunity to work in groups and discuss the material learned for that day. Overall it's a class to enojoy!</p>
